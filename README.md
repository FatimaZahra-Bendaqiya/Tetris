'''The aim in Tetris is simple; you bring down blocks from the top of the screen. 
You can move the blocks around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them. The blocks fall at a certain rate.
The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many complete horizontal lines of blocks as possible.
When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank.'''
